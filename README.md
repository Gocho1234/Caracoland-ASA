# Project 2 ASA

The goal of this project was to estimate for an imaginary country the maximum amount of trade between two regions that could be transferred to a rail network, minimizing infrastructure costs by only financing the sections that are strictly necessary. To solve the problem, we considered that each railroad station is represented by a vertex that connects to other stations through paths approximated by triangulation, forming a planar graph. Each path has a certain cost of infrastructure and we need to minimize it.
